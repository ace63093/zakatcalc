        <h2>What is Zakat?</h2>
        <p>Zakat is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and represents an obligatory form of charity. The word "Zakat" comes from the Arabic root meaning "to purify" or "to grow." By paying Zakat, Muslims purify their wealth and help it grow spiritually while supporting those in need.</p>
        <p>Unlike voluntary charity (Sadaqah), Zakat is a mandatory religious duty for eligible Muslims. It is calculated as 2.5% of one's accumulated wealth that has been held for one lunar year and exceeds the Nisab threshold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Who Must Pay Zakat?</h2>
        <p>Zakat is obligatory upon every Muslim who meets the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adult and sane:</strong> The person has reached puberty and is of sound mind.</li>
            <li><strong>Free:</strong> The person is not enslaved.</li>
            <li><strong>Wealth above Nisab:</strong> The person possesses wealth that exceeds the minimum threshold (Nisab) for one lunar year.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>The Nisab Threshold</h2>
        <p>Nisab is the minimum amount of wealth one must possess before Zakat becomes obligatory. It is measured in gold or silver:</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Gold Nisab:</strong> 85 grams (approximately 3 ounces) of pure gold</p>
            <p><strong>Silver Nisab:</strong> 595 grams (approximately 21 ounces) of pure silver</p>
        </div>
        <p>Most scholars recommend using the silver Nisab as it results in a lower threshold, allowing more people to participate in giving Zakat and benefit more recipients. However, you may consult a scholar for guidance based on your circumstances.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Zakatable Assets</h2>
        <p>Zakat is due on the following types of wealth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gold and Silver:</strong> Including jewelry, coins, and bullion (scholars differ on whether regularly worn jewelry is exempt).</li>
            <li><strong>Cash:</strong> Money in hand, bank accounts, and savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Assets:</strong> Merchandise and trade goods intended for sale.</li>
            <li><strong>Investments:</strong> Stocks, shares, and other financial instruments.</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Produce:</strong> With different rates depending on irrigation methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Livestock:</strong> Camels, cattle, and sheep (with specific thresholds).</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Many contemporary scholars consider crypto zakatable as a form of currency or tradeable asset.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Who Receives Zakat?</h2>
        <p>The Quran specifies eight categories of recipients eligible for Zakat (Surah At-Tawbah 9:60):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Al-Fuqara (The Poor):</strong> Those without sufficient means to meet basic needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Al-Masakin (The Needy):</strong> Those who have some means but still struggle.</li>
            <li><strong>Zakat Administrators:</strong> Those employed to collect and distribute Zakat.</li>
            <li><strong>Those Whose Hearts Are to Be Reconciled:</strong> New Muslims or those inclined toward Islam.</li>
            <li><strong>Freeing Captives:</strong> Helping those in bondage or slavery.</li>
            <li><strong>Those in Debt:</strong> People burdened with debt they cannot repay.</li>
            <li><strong>In the Cause of Allah:</strong> Supporting beneficial causes and charitable works.</li>
            <li><strong>The Wayfarer:</strong> Travelers stranded without resources.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>The Zakat Year (Hawl)</h2>
        <p>For Zakat to become obligatory on most types of wealth, the wealth must remain above the Nisab threshold for one complete lunar year (Hawl). This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wealth acquired during the year is added to existing wealth when calculating Zakat at year's end.</li>
            <li>If wealth falls below Nisab during the year and stays there, the Hawl resets.</li>
            <li>Many Muslims choose to calculate their Zakat during Ramadan for increased blessings.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Spiritual Benefits</h2>
        <p>Beyond its social function, Zakat carries profound spiritual benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purifies the soul from greed and attachment to material wealth.</li>
            <li>Increases blessings (barakah) in one's remaining wealth.</li>
            <li>Strengthens faith and connection to Allah.</li>
            <li>Builds community solidarity and mutual care among Muslims.</li>
            <li>Fulfills a fundamental obligation and brings one closer to Allah.</li>
        </ul>
